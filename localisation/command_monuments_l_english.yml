gerunanin_camp_title: "Gerunanin Headquarters and 'The Most Exemplary Tradezone'"
gerunanin_camp: "Shadakhad. Gerunanin Headquarters"
gerunanin_camp_desc: "Humans are fickle things Elves and Harimari doubly so, still the Empire needs comes before loyalty, and Korashi is not the only thing imported into the country. These needs could however be controlled and regulated, and Shadakhad would be perfectly suited for this purpose. Located on a navigable river flowing through Sir all the way to Tianlou, and sitting between the Demon hills, Rahen and Yanshen all manner of goods travel through its tired gates. The immense Human activity would also lend itself well to organising our Gerunanin and Wuyhun Auxilliaries."       
boar_camp_title: "The Boar Barracks"
boar_camp: "Boar Eternal Stables"
boar_camp_desc: "Endless warg howling and weapon grinding can be heard in the shadow of the Eastern Sepentspine Mountains. The central holdings of the Boar Command can be split into two districts. The warg stables known for breeding the most ferocious yet rideable wargs in the whole command, and the 'Boar stables' Endless Barracks known as such because their spartan and utilitarian appearance, these barracks are likewise known for training the most ferocious yet disiplined Hobgoblins in the whole command."
dragon_camp_title: "Dragon Sapper and Artillery proving ground"
dragon_camp: "Dragon Sapper Academy"
dragon_camp_desc: "Located far from the Commands heart and fielding a new force, the sappers and artillerymen of the dragon command often attracts odd looks from their fellow countrymen, even being seen as madmen by the most conservative. Endless lines of weird prototypes lining the academy grounds, a faint smell of gunpowder, and the feeling that a miniscule spark will paint everything in flames, does not help that impression. Their functions as indirect fire support and siege specialist is however only becoming more apparent as enemy walls grow thicker and sieges grow longer."       
elephant_camp_title: "Grand Manufactory of the Command"
elephant_camp: "Grand Manufactory of the Command"
elephant_camp_desc: "A good spear is difficult to produce, a sword doubly so, so when the main armament of the Command became precision firearms and its borders stretched like a rope about to break, something had to done. The Elephant Command was created and put to work creating enough pollution to kill their namesake animal. Enormous smokestacks and industrial activity became the sign of the Elephants domain, and no place is that more true than the Central Manufactory,"     
tiger_camp_title: "Grand office of the Command"
tiger_camp: "Grand Office of the Command"
tiger_camp_desc: "'No Hobgoblin should be laid to rest with a quill, but with the hilt of his sword in his hands!' is the battlecry of annoyed generals throughout the Command. 'And how will he pay for that sword, with the entrails of his enemies?' is most often the answer of the annoyed bureaucrats of the tiger command. Responsible for tax collection, trade protection and investment realisation. when everything is nearly rhyming, the tiger commands is often to be thanked."    
wolf_camp_title: "The grand mustering grounds"
wolf_camp: "Wolf Mustering/Depot Command"
wolf_camp_desc: "Armies marches on Calories and in this regard even the disiplined Hobgoblins must bow to reality. The wolf command hosts some of the most expansive and organised food stores in the world, meticulously inspected for rot and vermin by wolf quartermasters on the prowl. A grand field reaching to the horizon sits at the edge of the Depot District, ready for mustering armies as well as those returning from campaign."   
lion_camp_title: "School of the old Lion"
lion_camp: "School of the old Lion"
lion_camp_desc: "The most dangerous big cats in Rahen may be the Harimari but in the western Hobgoblin foothills another beast is taking shape, one with the fangs of a viper and eyes like an eagle. Once a school of learning for the rare literate Hobgoblin, now rapidly expanding as a school specialized in tactics, diplomacy and dirty tricks, officially on wolf command ground but funded and run by the Lion command. It has gained some repute as being open to all who can claim merit." 
nogod_temple_title: "The Great Debate hall of the Godless"
nogod_temple: "The Godless Temple"
nogod_temple_desc: "The grand Complex of endless debate and ink driven wars known to few by its official name 'Institute of philosophical and common debate of the god rejecting peoples' and known by most by the ironic name 'The godless temple'. These grand auditoriums and halls of learning are responsible not only for training new missionaries but the tax officials and feather-necked parchmentpushers of the future"
slaver_camp_title: "Tapamadh Prison/Slave Markets"
slaver_camp: "Tapamadh Slave Markets" 
slaver_camp_desc: "It is almost futile to understand the slave policy of the command. Humans toiling on plantations, literate and educated ogres and endless penal battalions of brown orcs are all known by the title 'slave'. The slaves of Tapamadh can however all be described as being of the chattel variety, squalid and disorganised tents and shacks litter an area in the foothills surrounded by large palisades, a piece of hell on earth housing political/war prisoners, criminals and other unfortunates. Although slavery is far from uncommon in Haeless, the conditions of the command's camps is something to behold, and this havn't really endeared future subjects to submit to conquest."
