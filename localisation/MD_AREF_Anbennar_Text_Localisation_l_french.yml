  # Age Painting Descriptions
 pic_age_of_greentide_desc: "The Battle of Rottenstep, 1443\n\nIn the summer of 1443, a bloody battle was decisively won by the Marcher Lords of Cannor, primarily human adventurers, deserters and veterans of the Lilac Wars, against the numerically superior Greentide Vanguard. The large orc force lead by Korgus Dookanson and his ten commanders were defeated after a fierce battle that almost went their way.\n\nThe outcome of the battle turned the Greentide around, as the orcs lost more than twice as many soldiers with 35,000 casualties vs 15,000 Marcher Lord deaths. Notably in the battle, a young squire woman named Corin lost her life defending her lord, Frederic Bennon, only to be resurrected by the disgraced god of war, Agrados, who named her his champion and avatar, effectively redeeming his legacy and causing her to replace him as the new god of war."
 pic_age_of_unraveling_desc: "Torrieth Godspeaker discovers the God Fragment\n\nTorrieth Godspeaker, an elven mage and High Rector of the Ravelian Church, was a leading figure of the expedition that found the God Fragment. She was also the first person who could interpret it's messages."
 pic_age_of_witchkings_desc: "Fortress of the Black Demesne\n\nOriginally developed by the ramblings of Adelar síl na Whistlehill, the religion of the Black Demesne began to take root when his writings were discovered in the Age of Witch Kings. He taught against the gods of the other religions and sought to establish a worldwide magocratic state led by mortal mages and not by dieties. The political union of the Black Demesne would be led by a powerful Sorcerer-King with 8 acolytes beneath him, ruling from the Skull Throne. The armies of the Black Demesne rely on necromancy and the resurrected dead."
 pic_age_of_artificers_desc: "Gnomish Heirarchy Battleship\n\nAs the Age of Witch-Kings draws to a close, the ingenuity and dominance of Gnomes in the fields of technology and magic would again take root in Halaan. The combination of tech and magic would lead to technological and military revolutions that would change the world."
