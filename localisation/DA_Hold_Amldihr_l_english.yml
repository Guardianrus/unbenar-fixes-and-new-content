 DA_Amldihr_Authority_event.3.d:0 "Verkal Vazkron was much more than what is usually considered a castle.\nThe entire hold served as a vast labyrinthian complex of massive fortifications, gates, and strong-points.\nAt its height said to be capable of stopping any would-be attacker indefinitely. As its name implied, Verkal Vazkron was the primary defensive line of Amldihr and tasked with the safety of the hold from both internal and external threats but there is more: Verkal Vazkron was connected to Amldihr, the Hall of the Ancestors and the Amlharaz through an highly developed system of tunnels. This allowed immediate deployment of reinforcement from and towards the whole Citadel Hold.\nWe have managed to restore most of this intricate system and our defensive capabilities in the area have benefited greatly from it. There were even some training grounds inside which we can now exploit without problems."

This is what appears to be Amlharaz. What we didn't know is that Amlharaz had another function: during times of war, when the High Assembly of Aul-Dwarov couldn't be held normally, it became an highly efficient War Council.\nThe High King and his ministers, together with lesser kings or their representatives managed war affairs, delivering orders to the other holds and their troops. This War council has been restored and we can use this well-established facility to deliver military orders more efficiently"

 DA_Amldihr_Authority_event.5.d:0 "After restoring some tunnels connecting Amldihr and the Hall of the Ancestors we come across a big Hall, walls full of etchings describing ancient miths: The birth of Dagrin Everbeard, the first dwarf, by the hands of Halanna, the Earth Goddess of old, is described with unbelievable detail. There are some parts which we don't understand. In these etchings the goddess seem to have fallen in a deep sleep to restore her lost powers. She appears to be in a kind of cocoon, protected by a massive structure built by Dagrin and his children.\nLeaving the miths aside, we focus on the hall and we find many unknown runes.\nAfter careful examination we come to understand these runes are harmless but we cannot comprehend what they should do.\nWe can activate the runes and find out or leave them be. Choice is yours to make."

I lived many years, too many maybe, helping our kind in times of need. At some point i understood my life was coming to an end and decided to abandon my mortal body out of my own will and be placed here, to teach future generations about many things and i will now help you in your endeavor. The amount of knowledge i have is probably too much for you to take in, send down here your specialists and i will help them solve their problems.''\nThe conversation is cut off by a kind of alarm and the ghost's image is fading quickly, then a frightening scream comes from below, way deeper than you currently are, but you are able to hear it nonetheless.\n''This .. so it is still there .. \nMy time is up, you can reactivate this runes once a month so don't worry about me. One important advice: If you want to go deeper than we currently are, brace yourself, what remains in that abyss is the most important secret of our race ...''\nThe image fades away completely and the runes lose their brilliance"

The eyes of everyone look at the §ORunic Gate§!, The two Gargantuans doors open and behind is scene of indescribable beauty.\n\nA Sphere with a diameter of roughly 10m is in the center of a colossal hall. Its whitish color radiates a sense of holiness and beauty difficult to describe with just words. The chief researcher is at a loss for words.\nAfter some hours and research we have come to discover that this was an old research facility which had studying this sphere as its only purpose.\nThey had come to understand that §OHalanna's Heart§!, which was what they called it, is an Enormous amount of compressed magical essence of which even the purest and biggest refined damestear would never even be able to contain a thousandth of it.\nWhat is even more surprising is the Discovery they made. It appears that at the center of §OHalanna's Heart§! there resides some kind of lifeform or at the very least a conscience but they were completely unable to interact with it.

You then hear her voice directly inside your head: 'My child, I am grateful to you for awakening me ages earlier than what i expected. As I have important matters to attend i cannot show you proper gratitude but i shall give you a gift that will help your country prosper and maybe defeat the challenge of time'.\nAs she Said so you can see numerous tatoos on her body starting to change shape continously, then, with a snap of her finger, a wave of magical essence spread out in every direction engulfing everything in its path.\n'May Our paths Cross again, My mortal children'.\nThen she disappears from sight."
