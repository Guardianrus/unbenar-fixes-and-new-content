This was truly an unexpected discovery, why should there have been an elven lab inside a dwarven hold?\nEven though we have many questions, The §GResearch Facility§! has shown particular interest in this and they wish to make a meticulous survey of the whole Lab.\n\nWe can't read precursor elven but we should be able to find someone who has this ability with a little funding"

My work has always been to study little, and most of the time useless, relics from the Precursor Empire.\nThis place is absolutely amazing and could revolutionize the known history of the Age before the Day of the Ashen Skies. I have identified the owner of this place. It was the infamous Ducaniel, one of the most powerful Precursor Elves and the Besieger of the Dwarovar during the ancient wars that ruined our Fatherland. I immensely thank you for the possibility of being here and i will put all my efforts in studying this place but i do not have the scientific knowledge necessary for these things.\nThe §GResearch Facility§! shuold be able to handle this matters way more efficiently than our team of archeologists'"

 DA_Hul_Jorkad_event.1.d:0 "'My Liege, i write this down because what we have opened here is certainly something big and i am not so sure about what it could mean. The Artificers were not enough and we had to call even biologists specialist. From what they say, we are sure samples of various sentient species of Halann were gathered in these places. The scripts i read  are all about a series of magical induced flesh infusions, projected to build some kind of super soldier. I sincerely hope that this monstrous technology did not found a fruitful application but considering that the elves could not conquer the Serpentspine probably it's this way.While i write this down, i see the smile in the artificers' faces. They are already seeking to reactivate this abomination and i sincerely think that if you give them enough money they will do it. May our Forefathers protect us from what can be created in this place.'"

The previous Head has left the position for reasons and prefers to only read ancient private documents he found in what we can consider a private room. The newly organized team has already activated part of the lab and we are actually using part of the data we found to make some basic experiments. Thanks to the newly activated machinaries, we have extracted some kind of magical-propensed elements from absolutely willing subjects and infused them in not so willing subjects (Kobolds). They are excellent text subjects, their reproductive abilities permits a continuous flow of new experimental material. About those reproductive abilities, after a few failed experiments, we successfully trasfered some magical propensity to not-propens subject. This subjects could make easily some basic spells but we observed a decrease in fertility in them. Maybe there is a correlation between magical propensity and fertility.\nI will send you more news in the next breakthrough.'"

I will now inform you about our 2 most recent breakthrough.\nWe have stopped the barbaric experiments on the kobolds as we have obtained all the necessary data going further down in the Hold's depths.\nDucaniel's creation was not a super soldier that was never brought to life: It was the orc race, Ducaniel created the orc race as an hybrid between elfs, goblins and desert ogres to trample over the dwarves in ancient times, and it was effective as the new orc race had little to no magic but great physical prowess, adaptability and extremely high fertility.\nWe have now completely understood the correlation between fertility, magical prowess and lifespan.\n\nThe other Breakthrough is that we are now able to utilize the magical genetic engineering to a certain extent, but it is a very costly process so we think it is better to use it on the [Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim]self or very few other individuals.'"
