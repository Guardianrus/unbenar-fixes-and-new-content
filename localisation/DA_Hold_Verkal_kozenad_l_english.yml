 DA_ADK_explore.203.d:0 "Our exploration Team has returned Empty Handed but they reported some peculiarities.\nWhile Surveying The Dig Level they came across several Etchings on the walls, most of them were some kind of warning while we are not too sure about the meaning of others. they have translated what was readable and reported their content:\n'DO NOT ENTER!'\n'THE ORCS *** COMING'\n'THE KING IS ****!'\n'May *** gods have mercy on us...'"

 DA_Verkal_Kozenad_event.1.d:0 "We managed to defeat the undead menace but there are some confusing reports from the battlefield.\n It seems most of the undeads were dwarfs and some orcs. The bodies have decayed a lot which indicates they have been turned a very long time ago. Another strange thing is that most of them were not your usual udead but were armed and organized through some kind of military formation.\nWe have secured the Hold for now but the undead menace is still strong. We need to understand what happened here to solve the situation and the only way to do so is to keep exploring the depths"

 DA_Verkal_Kozenad_event.2.d:0 "After defeating the Undeads we recovered some of the territoris the undeads occupied and we finally understood.\nAfter carefully sorting out various etchings we found along the way, some journals and our own deductions we came to what we believe transpired in this Hold.\nDuring the ancient time of Aul-Dwarov, while the various Holds were holding back the orcish invasion unleashed by our archenemy, the precursor elf Ducaniel, from Hul-Jorkad, Verkal Kozenad's King made a pact with Ducaniel.\nIf Ducaniel helped him reach immortality he would have opened the gates of Verkal Kozenad to let the orcish invasion come unhindered. Ducaniel accepeted the proposal and turned the Traitorous king into an immortal lich. The High ranking officers discovered the betrayal but it was too late, the gates were opened. They were not able to fend off the orcish invasion and decided to hold them off while trying to seal away their King. After a strenous battle they managed to confine the King in his palace and sealed the whole place with Runic magic. They died afterwards to the orcish invasion and we suppose the Lich managed to cast necromancy spells from inside the palace in order to free himself. We managed to reach the chained palace but only a powerful mage can approach it and we hope your highness will put an end to this matter"

 DA_ADK_explore.206.d:0 "As we explore the deepest place ever reached by the opal dwarfs a strange sight awaits us there.\nSeveral ethereal figures approach us from afar and our exploration team grows anxious.\nAround 150 meters from us we hear a voice:\n'Do not fear us, brothers. We have no ill intent. We are the renmants of the opal dwarfs. To be precise we are the mages who sealed the Treacherous King in his palace many years ago'\nAnother soul steps up and says 'We discarded our physical bodies many years ago to escape the orcish invasion and we lost most of our power while doing so. We had but one regret left, not managing to kill what was once our king.'\n'...But this does not seem to be the case anymore, as we are not able to perceive his presence anymore. Were you the ones who ended his life?'\nThe exploration team captain steps up and explains the past events with detail. After 2 hours of discussion the ghosts says:'We thank you for avenging our brothers and sisters. We no longer have material properties which could help you but our knowledge would probably be useful to your nation and we are willing to help'"
