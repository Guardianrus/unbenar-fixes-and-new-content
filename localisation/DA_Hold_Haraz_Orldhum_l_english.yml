There are many High class buildings, many of which could rival those of our court, but the amount of cages, chained skeletons and prisons we found along the way was absurd.\nA peculiarity was reported: It seems we found a massive platinum armor, too big to wear normally, in one of this high class residences. After searching for clues about it, we came to know this 'armor' is but an exoskeleton, a self-powered suit made to enhance the user's physical prowess and was apparently bestowed to the owner of this house as a reward for military accomplishments. The suit is too damaged to make any sense out of it but, if only we could locate where they produced it ....\n\nWe took back some riches and what was left of the armor anyway.\n"

Implementing this will cost us a considerable amount of money, maybe permanently increasing our military expenses.\nIt is all up to yout Highness:\n-We could allow all of our military to use this new product, insanely increasing our military expenses and reducing the amount of troops we can have.\n-We could give this Exoskeletons to truly exceptional man in our military, as a medal of honor of sorts, the same as old Haraz Orldhum. This is the less expensive option.\n-We could make it so our vanguards and strategic positions in our army are assisted by the enhanced soldiers.
