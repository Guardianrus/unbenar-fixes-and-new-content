 amldihr.101.t:0 "The Aul Kron Dhûmankon"
 amldihr.101.d:0 "Amldihr, meaning Gates of the Assembly, was where the united empire of Aul-Dwarov was founded and where the High Assembly of Holds met to advise the High King, who bore the legendary Dwarovkron. Ruled by a legislative body representing the various clans throughout the mountains, Aul-Dwarov, in particular, was home to the unique High Assembly, or Amlharaz, which was a council that comprised of the lesser kings and their most powerful subjects.\n\nNow, we bore the name of this legendary hold, who for centuries, if not millennia, was soiled by the Black Orcs.\n\nFew Dwarves object to the recreation of a High King, and many wish to see the Assembly of Holds reestablished, eventually reclaiming the mountains and reforming Aul-Dwarov in all its glory. Many, however, are hesitant to give their power to a sole monarch, even [Root.Monarch.GetName], whom most in our company would give their life for. The clans are an ancient institution, one who may simply create the complacency, nepotism, and decadence that left the Old Dwarovar unprepared for its impending doom.\n\nTwo factions formed over the issue of how to run this new government. One group, originally called the Amlavad az Nez, desired a government by the people. Dwarves would be allowed to vote for their High King, who in theory would rule as suited the people of Amldihr, and not for the clans' will or for self-serving purposes. The other group was the Dwarven clans, the most powerful of which were the Adstunad, Azgheled, Nezvelad, and Shazstun clans. These clans, who had committed many of their own hired adventurers and thousands of crowns in funding to the refounding of Amldihr, expected representation, and appealed to many, more conservative, Dwarves’ sense of tradition and duty.\n\nIn the end, a new system was established, the Aul Kron Dhûmankon, or All Crown Domain. In this system, often called simply the All Crown System, important individuals, mostly land-owning Dwarves, would vote on their preferred candidate, and that candidate would become the High King and rule effectively as a Monarch. Eventually the two parties would begin to be referred to as simply The Reformists and The Clans. However, this system was far from perfect, as ideally each ruler would rule for ten years, but if the Clans held popular support, they would often rule for life. Throughout Amldihr’s fresh new history, it was a constant political battle, and both parties would experience at moments incredible popular support and at other times debilitating opposition to their respective positions."

 amldihr.102.t:0 "Knights in Shining Mithril"
 amldihr.102.d:0 "As we begin our resettlement of our ancient homelands, we swear this most sacred vow: that we shall restore the Dwarovar to its former glory and we shall restore all mountain-born dwarves to the rule of Amldihr, for the protection and stability of our kind. We will restore every corner of every cave and tunnel to dwarven rule and spread the faith of our ancestors as we do so. Unfortunately, although the battle at the edges of our borders is simple as clearing out our caves from the foul greenskins, the battle at home is much more nuanced. Although our elective monarchal system provides some stability in the form of popular rule, there are those elements of society that are nothing but chaos, pure destruction of order. In order to provide for the safety of the High King and his family from these elements, from this day forward we proclaim the creation of the Amldihr Royal Guard, colloquially known as the Mithril Royal Guard, due to their armor being only the highest quality, purest, and most well-crafted mithril sourced directly from the mithril hold."

 amldihr.103.d:0 "Er-Natvir, a millennium or two ago, was the center of commerce in Aul-Dwarov. They controlled the central Railyard where all traffic from all the major Dwarven railways met. As such Er-Natvir gained most of its wealth and fame from the trade of goods. However, with the goblins having squatted in this beautiful hold for centuries, it has fallen into disrepair. It will take some funding as well as some initiative to bring Er-Natvir back up to its full glory. Luckily, in addition to state funding, three groups have come forward offering to aid in the reconstruction of Er-Natvir and its many districts, each with their own agendas, of course.\n\nThe Merchants wish to return Er-Natvir to its former glory, a center of trade and the junction through which all goods travel through.\n\nAn up-and-coming group calling themselves “Artificers” has requested that Er-Natvir be used for the transfer of ideas and technology.\n\nFinally, the clergy wish to spread the ancient Dwarven faith, as they believe Dwarvenkind has forgotten their ancestors, and our old faith is the key to stability and to lead fulfilling Dwarven lives."

 amldihr.104.t:0 "Bulwark of the North"
 amldihr.104.d:0 "Once known as the “Hold of the Highlords”, known for their chivalric people, beacons of nobility and virtue, the finest knights were trained in Haraz Orldhûm. In days of old, when clans ruled the government absolutely, many High Kings hailed from Haraz Orldhûm, and although today the High King may be born of any clan or even no clan at all, having this hold under our influence will be a massive gain in the legitimacy of our rule over the Dwarovar. This, coupled with the growing influence of the Orcish kingdoms outside of the mountains, means there is only to gain from creating a bulwark on our borders with Haraz Orldhûm as our stalwart march. Only some small concession of autonomy in these regions is required of us, which will no doubt be seen as a small price to pay on our campaign to refound Aul-Dwarov."
 amldihr.104.a:0 "Haraz Orldhûm will be our defense against the Greentide remnants."

 amldihr.105.t:0 "A Fractious Disagreement"
 amldihr.105.d:0 "Officials from Krakdhûmvror and Orlazam-az-dihr have come to the High King with a proposal. Both are in complete agreement that the defense of Amldihr and the surrounding holds is of paramount importance. The old walls and defenses simply will not do for the modern era. Where they disagree, however, is just how to improve said defenses. Krakdhûmvror, as one of the more developed and experienced holds, one which has remained since the Old Dwarovar, is no stranger to defense. Orcs, Goblins, and Giants are just some of the beasts that had to be fended off from breaching the walls of Krakdhûmvror. They suggest the straightforward approach: Using Icecraft to strengthen the foundation. This will make it harder to break down our walls and easier to slow down our enemies.\n\nOrlazam-az-Dihr, on the other hand, disagrees. With the advent of high velocity weaponry and rediscovering and dissemination of gunpowder, stronger walls will do little if there are not men who can guard the walls. They suggest that through investing in the betterment of the Serpent’s Vale, more money can be produced, and more men can be conscripted or hired to fight, bettering our defenses indirectly, but more effectively.\n\nWhat both are conveniently omitting, however, is that investing into either idea directly benefits the proposing party. Investing in icecraft means Krakdhûmvror gets better defenses for themselves using state funding, and investing in the Vale means Orlazam gets much of the runoff profits."
 amldihr.105.a:0 "We will use icecraft to improve our defense. Amldihr will not fall again."
 amldihr.105.b:0 "Strengthening our economy will strengthen our defense."
 
 amldihr.106.t:0 "Return of the King"
 amldihr.106.d:0 "An Assembly is called in Amldihr’s Halls. Lords flood into the assembly halls, many tired from the journey. As exhausted Dwarves take their seats there was silence, an overwhelming sense of uncertainty amongst the noble crowd. The table before them was vast, meant to seat hundreds. Horns and drums fill the air as the last of the lords take their seats. [Root.Monarch.GetName] enters the hall, surrounded by Royal Guards clad in mithril shields and armor, their faces obscured by a cage of blue-white. [Root.Monarch.GetName] enters wearing the Crown of Amldihr, a crown bearing the weight of an empire. [Root.Monarch.GetName] walks to the end of the table, pierced by the eyes of hundreds of lords, and after a pause that felt as if it took hours, [Root.Monarch.GetName] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] goblet and takes a momentous swig!\n\nThe Lords immediately erupt in cheers and laughter, raising their goblets and drinking all their stomachs can handle. [Root.Monarch.GetName] lowers [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] goblet, expecting nothing less. This was a new age for the Dwarves of the Serpentspine. An age not for lonely holds and lone adventurers. This was not the Dwarovar of centuries past. This was something different.\n\nMuch of the surrounding mountains has been solidified. Every hold under our reign prospers with the fields in the Serpent’s Vale aplenty. Amldihr surpasses even the holds of Old Amldihr and Grônstunad and our reign is legitimized by the people as well as the clans. This was something different, something better, and indeed something that will become so much more..."

 amldihr.108.d:0 "For too long have they squatted in Grônstunad, using the walls built by our ancestors to protect their despicable hierarchy. A poor representation of civilized government, if you could even call them civilized at all. They are not green, but they are our enemies nonetheless. Enemies to all Dwarves.\n\nWe are ready for our fight against this Hobgoblin menace. We have gathered forces from all over the Serpentspine, from our professional soldiers to mercenaries to adventurers, from our Royal Guard and the Riders of Amldihr, to the men and woman who have volunteered for this fight with their own arms. It would be false to say our people are willing, for they are not just willing, they are raring for this fight, to unite the Serpentspine once and for all.\n\nWe shall attack on my command…"

 amldihr_dutch_republic_reform_desc:0 "Meaning "All Crown Domain", or less literally, Crown Owned by All— Amldihr was originally ruled completely by the Dwarven Clans in the Assembly. Our nation, however, formed by intrepid adventurers and entrepreneurial burghers, while respectful of tradition and the ways of the Old Dwarovar, was all too wary of the disastrous consequences complete clan dominance had on the Aul-Dwarov. So a compromise was reached. A new system of government called the All Crown Domain, or often simply the All Crown System, was put in place.\n\nThis system gave the common people (burghers, clergy, and landowning Dwarves mostly) say in who their high king was. These Dwarves are called Reformists, after the Dwarves who advocated for this system at Amldihr's refounding. The other group recognized by the All Crown System, the Dwarven Clans, or simply “the Clans”, were ancient nobility tracing their roots to Aul-Dwarov. While the Reformists are in power they favor a republican-style of government, with strict term limits. When the Clans hold sway, the ruler of Amldihr rules for life, or until he or she steps down.\n\n§gEach of your rulers will rule for either a 6-year term, or for life, depending on who currently holds more sway. Also available is the “Step Down as Ruler” decision.§!"

 amldihr_high_monarchy_reform_desc:0 "In this form of government, the High Kingship has become a hereditary monarchy, throwing off the shackles of the elected monarchal system established at the founding of Amldihr. To prevent the stagnation of past eras from setting in once again, the High King, upon his proclamation, signed the All-Dwarves Pact, a document which guaranteed local laws would remain unabridged and popular petitions would be recognized and brought to the King himself for review and implementation. Although in effect absolute rule was in the hands of the High King, many were willing to waive individual sovereignties in exchange for a strong and united Dwarven Serpentspine."

We will set up courts made up of only the most qualified judges, and allow individual holds to interpret laws made by the state based on such things as textualism, precedent, and moral reasoning."

 I01_restructure_reforms_desc:0 "Pretenders of Aul-Dwarov have risen up exponentially since the mass-leaving of the Black Orcs from the Serpentspine. Many claim the title of true successors of the Dwarven Empire. But as rulers atop Amldihr and as guardians of the Serpent’s Vale, our people know we are the true successors, and our people are willing to fight not just for their king, but for their people."

 I01_amldvazhad_guard:0 "Mithril Royal Guard"
 I01_amldvazhad_guard_desc:0 "Thousands of years ago, before the collapse of the Dwarovar, stood the High King on his hill, and beside him stood the legendary Amldvazhad Guard. These men came from the highest nobility. It was often said in the Old Dwarovar 'If you can't be the King, be the King's Guard'. Having a fourthborn or fifthborn son as an Amldvazhad Guard gave great prestige, and was one of the highest honors a knight could be granted.\n\nToday, our High King faces more dangers than ever before. The threat of Orcs, Goblins, Kobolds, and even fellow Dwarves are ever present. Every hold, company, and clan is attempting to carve out their place in the mountains. If we are to reconquer what is rightfully ours, to reforge the old empire, we must revive the Old Guard, but they must be more discplined, professional, and elite than ever before. With the conquest of Mithradhûm, we may supply our Royal Guard with armor and weapons that not even the sharpest blade could pierce or the heaviest hammer could crush. A Royal Guard with an armor of icy blue and a deadly efficiency to match."
