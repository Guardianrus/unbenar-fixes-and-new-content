DA_ADK_explore.105.t: "The Setzunkhupa"
DA_ADK_explore.105.d: "Our expedition In Dûr-Vazhatun has found an old archive.\nAfter an extensive search of the place, we found out this place recorded the blueprints and construction progresses of The Setzunkhupa, the old dwarven observatory, maybe the only dwarven great project above the surface.\nDûr-Vazhatun, the legendary home of the sky watchers, was one of the few holds had interest in affairs beyond the surface and was Known for its ancient observatory,The Setzunkhupa.\nWe have the possibility to reestablish the facility and continue their research among the stars."
DA_ADK_explore.105.a: "Excellent work"
DA_ADK_explore.105.tooltip: "The Setzunkhupa construction will become available, every tier needs 2 dig levels to be upgraded, starting from dig level 3 to upgrade to tier 1, dig 5 to tier 2, dig 7 to tier 3."

 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.1.d:0 "Even if we cannot compare ourselves with the legendary sky watchers, we have finished the initial restoration works and some of us are already starting to whatch through the lenses of the Setzunkhupa. It is not possible to see things too distant from Halann right now: a higher resolution image of the moon is probably the best we will be able to achieve for some time, but even that is difficult right now.\nWell, restoration works are still needed, so we didn't expect much, but we are glad to know the Setzunkhupa is already operational to a certain extent.\n"
 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.1.a:0 "Excellent"

 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.2.t:0 "Moon's Damestear?"
 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.2.d:0 "After careful observation of the moon, we came to understand most of the moon's surface is full of damestear. There are several holes and craters all over its surface so we have theorized that the moon was and still is being invested by numerous damestear meteorites.\nThe amount of wealth on that moon is probably enough to buy the whole world.\n"
 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.2.a:0 "Yeah, just some thousands of kilometers apart from us"

 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.3.t:0 "A Crazy Idea"
 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.3.d:0 "Your Highness, the restoration and expansion works are all proceeding as intended but ... there is one issue: After seeing the damestear deposits on the moon some dwarfs are theorizing different way to either reach the moon or bringing down the damestearfrom there. Those were just theories but it became a problem when the Chief Researcher decided to support one of this theories...\nHe wants to use a strange resonance there is between mage and damestear to literally have damestear meteorites come down on us. He literally wants to summon a meteorite.\n"
 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.3.a:0 "Based"
 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.3.b:0 "Abort this madness right now"
 DA_no_meteorites_tt:0 "The Chief Researcher will no longer try to bring down a damestear meteorite on us"

 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.30.t:0 "Damestear Meteorite"
 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.30.d:0 "Quite the strange situation: we are in the throne room and in front of you stands the ex-Chief Researcher, a great man of science, now charged with the crime of killing hundreds and hurting thousands of his own by calling forth a damestear meteorite.\nYou sigh a bit and then ask: ''Chief Researcher, do you mind explaining the meanings of your actions?'' The Chief Researcher ponders for a moment and then starts explaining: ''Your Highness is a person of culture, so you are surely able to understand how great of a feat i have performed. I perfected a method to make a damestear meteorite land on our territory on command. The amount of Damestear we can obtain this way is incalculable.''\n''I understand that many lives were lost because of my rash decisions but there was no other way to test it. Now that the process has been carried out once I have adjusted some details and we should now be able to make it so the meteorite lands in a predetermined position and evacuate the people beforehand in order to avoid unnecessaryy sacrifices. I am also aware of the lives which were lost in this process and i am ready to face the consequences of my actions.''\nNow you wonder what to do: having him executed is one option but .. you could also keep him around, even though it could result in some other problems in the future.\n You stand up to announce your decision: ''If we find out it is controllable after careful analysis, we will use your method and you.."
 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.30.a:0 ".. will be imprisoned for life"
 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.30.b:0 ".. will retain your position, but no other chances"
 DA_meteorites_tt:0 "You can now attract damestear meteorites towards a certain predetermined province outside the serpentspine.\nThe province need 15 development. The meteorite takes 2 years to reach its destination, the decison is usable every 5 years from the Research Facility Menu."

 DA_Madman_Chief_researcher:0 "Madman as Chief Researcher"
 desc_DA_Madman_Chief_researcher:0 "We let the Chief Researcher go back to his position after damestear meteorite accident. His passion is higher than ever, we just hope he won't try other highly dangerous experiments."

 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.4.t:0 "Astral Terror"
 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.4.d:0 "We have finished the restoration works of the Setzunkhupa and we can theorically use it.\nAs always there is one problem, after digging deep inside Dûr-Vazhatun, we came to understand what caused the downfall of our ancestors. Apparently, observing the Starry sky for substantial amount of times leads to madness. the ancient documents describe some horrendous creatures but we are not too sure whether they are the patient's hallucinations or something truly out there.\nWe are now at a crossroad, we can decide to look up in the sky and risk our sanity or keep the Setzunkhupa unused."
 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.4.a:0 "We need to know the truth"
 DA_Dur_Vazhatun_event.4.b:0 "Do not use it"
