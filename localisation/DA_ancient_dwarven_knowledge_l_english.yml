After further investigation we ended up reaching a reinforced door with the royal emblem on it.\nWe tried various methods to try bringing the door down and were finally succesfull with a bit of explosives.

 DA_ADK_explore.16.d:0 "Our exploration team has returned from their mission with abundant riches but they all seem quite restless.\nThe Captain, reporting in the royal hall, says: 'Your Highness, we are afraid to have brought back with us something more than just gold. We went inside a seemingly empty goblin nest, took everything we found, and returned. The problem is that there have been some disappearances while travelling back and some screams could be heard from time to time.'\nAs he said so, a feral Screech came from The Depths and the Alarm was triggered.\n'Your Highness, A goblin Tide!'\nYou stand up: 'I want every soldier to take up arms and gather in the market hall, We will take them all down!'\n'YES, Your Highness!'\nAfter sometime you mutter to yourself: 'Why is it always goblins'"
